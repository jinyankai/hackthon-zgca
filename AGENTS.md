# Agent Operating Contract

This repository is optimized for coding-agent work. Keep this file short: it is a map to deeper project knowledge, not the full manual.

## Start Here

- Read `docs/agent-harness/index.md` before large or unfamiliar changes.
- Prefer repository-local docs, tests, evals, logs, and configs over chat memory.
- Preserve existing user changes. Do not revert unrelated work.
- Before editing, identify the relevant module, owner, checks, and expected evidence.

## Canonical Checks

- Run `python evals/smoke_eval.py` for harness sanity.
- Run `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"` for baseline tests.
- If the project has its own test command, document it in `docs/agent-harness/quality.md` and prefer that command.

## Tool and MCP Policy

- Follow `docs/agent-harness/tools.md`.
- Do not use destructive commands or external network tools unless the task and approvals require them.
- Record important tool outputs in the final answer: tests, evals, CI, logs, screenshots, traces, or exact files.

## Review Policy

- Use `docs/agent-harness/review.md` before proposing completion.
- Claims about behavior must be backed by evidence.
- If a check cannot run, state why and identify the residual risk.
